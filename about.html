			<h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<p>I received my Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering in 2018 from the University of Arkansas where my main focus was working with FPGAs.
				During the last year at the UofA, I worked in the Smart Embedded Systems lab working with a number of technologies ranging from networking to 
				Elliptic Curve Encryption used to create a hardware wallet for bitcoin. I gained a lot of experience with Linux and cloud computing while working 
				at the UofA. After graduating, I began working for QuickFlex, Inc., a company that contracts with the goverment on ground breaking hardware and software
				designs. At QuickFlex, I was a software engineer/principal investigator working with FPGAs. After working with FPGAs for over two years, I realized
				I wanted something different and with a passion for design, I decided to make a career change and began learning as much as I could since May of this
				year. I have done some small scall websites using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and JQuery. My goal is to begin learning frameworks such as Bootstrap and working
				with libraries like React as I continue my journey into Web Development.
