			<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
			<div id="projectSec">
				<div id="tipCalc" class="imgRight">
					<p>The tip calculator is a Javascript project that I found while exploring CodePen. 
						This project was one of the first that projects I did using Javascript after I had gained enough experience with HTML and CSS.
						It is a very simple web app that once takes the bill amount, a percentage rating based on a service rating, and the number of 
						people that the bill will be split between to calculate the proper tip.</p>

				<div id="clock" class="imgLeft">
					<a href="https://mhamilton91.github.io/Clock/"><img class="squareImage" src="Clock.png"></img></a>
					<p>The Javascript clock project the second project that I completed while working 
						the 30 Days of Javascript coding challenge. The project takes in the current time and then sets the degrees based on the respective time 
						unit, seconds, minutes, and hours.</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div id="drumKit" class="imgRight">
					<p>The interactive drum kit page was the first 30 Days of Javascript 
						project that I completed. The page is set up so that the user can either press the keyboard keys marked for each part of the drum or the user can 
						click on the buttons to play the corresponding drum sound. The original project didn't address the user being able to click on the buttons
						but I felt that it would allow the user more control and it added the ability to play the sounds on a smart phone or tablet.</p>

				<div id="leona" class="imgLeft">
					<a href="https://mhamilton91.github.io/Leona/"><img class="recImage" src="Leona.png"></img></a>
					<p>The Leona band page is a page that I am currently working on for a 
						friend's band to start on a personal project to work on my development skills. The website, currently, does not have any Javascript but there are plans 
						to add much more to the website as things move forward. This is the first website that I have worked on with a customer to work on the functionality 
						and design of the website.</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div id="lumi" class="imgRight">
					<p>The product landing page is a project that I did while following the 
						Free Code Camp projects at the end of the HTML/CSS section. The page features only HTML and CSS. I found the LUMI keyboard on Kickstarter 
						and decided to use this as my landing page since I could easily pull information that came directly from the Kickstarter campaign to fill 
						out the information for the product landing page.</p>
